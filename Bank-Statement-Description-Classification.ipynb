    "# Bank Statement Description Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook provides a machine learning approach to classify bank statement descriptions into predefined categories. Bank statement descriptions often contain abbreviated or vague information, making it challenging to interpret their meaning. By classifying these descriptions into categories, financial institutions can better analyze transaction data for various purposes such as fraud detection, customer segmentation, and trend analysis.\n",
